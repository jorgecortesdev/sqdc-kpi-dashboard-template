# SQDC+ KPI Dashboard Template for Software Engineers

This repository provides a structured **KPI Dashboard Template** based on the **SQDC+ Framework (Safety, Quality, Delivery, Cost, Continuous Improvement)**. It is designed to help **Software Engineers**, **Senior PHP Developers**, and **Engineering Teams** define, measure, and track performance with clear success zones:

| Zone | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ðŸ”´ Red | Problems needing immediate action |
| ðŸŸ¡ Yellow | Needs improvement |
| ðŸŸ¢ Green | Competitive performance |
| ðŸ”µ Blue | Best-in-class performance

## Purpose

This template serves as a guide for:
- Performance reviews
- Continuous improvement
- Technical leadership
- Team management
- Self-assessment for developers
